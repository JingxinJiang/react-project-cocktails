      <h4>My Inspiration</h4>
      <p>
        Furuta Mamoru is my favorite, inspiring Professor. He has a wide range of knowledge
         and is a responsible and diligent man. I learned a lot of knowledge and learned to
          be responsible from him. When I worked at his lab. I was responsible for the 
          high-performance thin-film transistor project with Tokyo Electronics. 
          I designed the plan according to the requirements, hosted the meeting, 
          reported, and discussed the results with the engineers of the company. 
          Finally, I successfully fabricated high-reliability thin-film transistors. 
          I improved myself and gained the reliance of Tokyo Electronics company.
